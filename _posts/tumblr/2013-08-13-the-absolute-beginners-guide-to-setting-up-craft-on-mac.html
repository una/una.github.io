<p><span>This blog post assumes that you&#8217;ve never set up any kind of server environment on your system before and have no idea how to get started. It&#8217;s not the only way, but it&#8217;s an inclusive set of directions to follow. If you&#8217;ve already read the </span><a href="http://docs.buildwithcraft.com/installing/installing.html" target="_blank">Craft Installation Docs</a><span>, and were confused, then this post is for you.</span></p>
<ol><li>First you&#8217;ll want to install a program like <a href="http://www.MAMP.info/" target="_blank">MAMP</a> (free version is sufficient) or XAMPP. These programs basically bundle install Apache, MySQL, and PHP on your system, and make it easy to access them with a GUI that gives you start and stop buttons.</li><li>Start the MAMP installation and follow the steps. Choose &#8220;Install for all users of this computer&#8221;.</li><li>To help you manage your MySQL databases, Sequel Pro will be installed in the process automatically. You&#8217;ll find the application in the MAMP folder.</li><li>Start the MAMP App and choose the option &#8220;Launch MAMP&#8221; (not MAMP Pro!).<br /></li>
<img src="../../../images/posts/craft/01-MAMP-start-screen.jpg"/>
<li>During start-up process, choose &#8220;Allow incoming network connections&#8221;.</li><li>Your browser should then show your local MAMP homepage. (If you click on &#8220;localhost&#8221; in the address field of your browser, you will see the complete address &#8220;localhost:8888/MAMP/?language=English&#8221;.) On the MAMP page in the left column you will find your login parameters to connect with a database.<br /><img alt="image" src="../../../images/posts/craft/02-MAMP-local-homepage.jpg"/></li><li>Open Sequel Pro and use these parameters to open a connection. Your host should be &#8220;localhost&#8221; or &#8220;127.0.0.1&#8221; and your use name and password are probably both &#8220;root.&#8221;<br/><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/09f96e89575144a4a4b349c49efd1bfa/tumblr_inline_mrec19sE301qz4rgp.png"/><br/><br/></li><li>After hitting &#8220;Connect,&#8221; create a new database by clicking Database &gt; Add Database, or option + shift + A. Name your database something that makes sense to your project. We&#8217;ll go with &#8220;myprojectbase&#8221;</li>
<li>Go to <a href="http://buildwithcraft.com" target="_blank">buildwithcraft.com</a> and download the latest version of Craft.</li>
<li>Navigate to &#8220;applications/MAMP/htdocs&#8221; folder and create a folder &#8220;myproject&#8221; inside (or any other name, just don&#8217;t call it &#8220;Craft&#8221; to avoid confusion.) While it might not be necessary to set up a folder for your project, it&#8217;s nice to have one since local installs of Craft are free and you could set up another folder for another local Craft project and have things separated.<br /><img alt="image" src="../../../images/posts/craft/03-Craft-project-folder-in-MAMP-htdocs.jpg"/></li>
<li>In your unzipped Craft folder you&#8217;ll find the two folders &#8220;craft&#8221; and &#8220;public&#8221;. Move both into your project folder (&#8220;myproject&#8221;, if you follow our example.)<li>Navigate to craft/config/db.php and open the db.php file in any text editor.</li><li>Edit this file with your MySQL and database information. If you used MAMP, yours will look similar to this example, except maybe for the database name:
<pre><code>&lt;?php

return array(

/**
 * The database server name or IP address.
 */
'server' =&gt; '127.0.0.1',

/**
 * The database username to connect with.
 */
'user' =&gt; 'root',

/**
 * The database password to connect with.
 */
'password' =&gt; 'root',

/**
 * The name of the database to select.
 */
'database' =&gt; 'myprojectbase',

/**
 * The prefix to use when naming tables. This can be no more than 5 characters.
 */
'tablePrefix' =&gt; 'craft',

);</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Rename your &#8220;htaccess&#8221; file to &#8220;.htaccess&#8221; (just add a &#8220;.&#8221; in front of it) and delete the web config file. This can be tricky, as your computer may complain. If it says that this is a reserved name, make sure to go to enable hidden files. To do this, open your Terminal and type in:
<pre><code>defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles YES</code></pre> Restart finder and try to rename the file again.</li><li>At this point, if you followed those instructions directly, you should be able to go to localhost:8888/myproject/public/admin or 127.0.0.1:8888/myproject/public/admin in your web browser. This is how you will access the admin panel later.</li><li>From here, press the big Install button and let Craft take you through the setup process.</li><li>Your (public-facing) website should be accessible at localhost:8888/myproject/public or 127.0.0.1:8888/myproject/public/ Enter one of these urls during the Craft install</li></ol><p>Read about my experience using Craft to build <a href="http://proofessor.co" target="_blank">Proofessor</a> <a href="http://viget.com/extend/behind-the-scenes-building-proofessor" target="_blank">HERE</a>. That post will also show you how to get a little fancier and set up a virtual host. It also shows you the back end of how to actually use Craft.</p>
