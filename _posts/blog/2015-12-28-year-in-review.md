[Last year](http://una.im/2015-resolutions) I started a (now annual) tradition of reviewing my personal goals, and setting new ones. Looking back, **I can't believe how much has happened this year.** It's definitely been a roller coaster, and I've definitely grown a ton as a person. Thank you all for joining me on this journey!

## 2015 Retrospective

Here are a few projects I've launched over the past year (all source code available on GitHub, where I made **2,396 commits** this year):

- [Sass Director](http://sassdirector.com/): A file generator for Sass partials that uses a single "director script" (aka your `main.scss`)
- [Gulp Starter Environment](https://github.com/una/gulp-starter-env): Created for the designers I worked with to learn gulp and get familiar with using Github.
- [Happy Moments](http://happy-moments.herokuapp.com): A node app that pulls in a single happy moment memory from each day I've had this year.
- [Travels](http://travels.surge.sh/): A web experiment site that uses filters and blend modes, featuring my travel poetry as content.
- [CSSgram](http://una.im/cssgram): A tiny CSS library recreating Instragram filters using just CSS features.
- [Toolsday](http://toolsday.io/): A 20-ish-minute podcast about the latest in tech tools, tips, and tricks (hosted along with my coworker, [Chris](https://twitter.com/chrisdhanaraj))
- [arttheweb.com](http://arttheweb.com/): A collection of my articles, talks, and web experiments based around designing in the browser.

That was all outside of work. At IBM, I worked on two large-scale pattern libraries (one for Watson and one for Bluemix), built prototypes for product iterations, and helped build a Front-End Development community and curriculum for trainings.

### Knowledge Sharing

Last year, I said I wanted to "participate in conferences and community" as one of my goals. With that dream in mind, I went about applying to speak at conferences, hoping to get invited to one. Here's what actually happened:

<img src="../../images/posts/2015-review/dog.gif" alt="dog gif">

I gave **17 talks/workshops** on Sass, UI interaction, performance optimizations, keyboard ninjary, open source design, goal setting, and CSS filters and blend modes. I wrote **30 blog posts** on topics ranging from experimental (like [Generative Pixel Art](http://una.im/sass-pixel-art/) via Sass matrices and blend-mode hacks to create [Faux 3d Effects](http://una.im/3d-effect), to quite practical ([5 Uses for Sass Maps](http://www.sitepoint.com/5-great-uses-sass-maps/) and a class-based [CSS architecture](http://una.im/classy-css/) system). I also *recorded audio for every post I wrote on my blog* and the audiobook version of the <a href="http://svgpocketguide.com/book/">SVG Pocket Guide</a>. And finally, I started a **podcast** about developer tools called [Toolsday](http://toolsday.io)!

<blockquote class="left">If you'd like to support my code calligraphy or just send a simple thank you, I made an <a href="http://amzn.com/w/2BOPP6HPWDL9S">Amazon wishlist</a> of pens, paper, and audiobooks :)</blockquote>

I also started doing **code calligraphy** as a way to visualize some mnemonic devices and solidify my skills. People on Twitter seemed to really resonate with them, so I want to make more. A lot of people mentioned that they wanted prints, a book, or posters. I've got some ideas, but we'll see how it pans out with time.

### Other Things

I traveled *a lot* this year. According to my TripIt data, I traveled a total of **139,872 miles** to **29 cities** in **8 countries**. Where? Australia, England, Belgium, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, and France (and many trips around the US too). While short conference trips can be taxing, I do really love to travel. My [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/unakravets/) is now full of photos from my adventures *and* I got to meet so many awesome people (the best part of conferences)!

I started to read a lot, too (by read, I really mean *listen* to audiobooks). I finished **51 books** [this year](https://github.com/una/personal-goals/blob/master/ideas-and-misc/book-checklist.md). My favorites were:

- *Ready Player One* by Ernest Cline
- *All the Light We Cannot See* by Anthony Doerr
- *The Martian* by Andy Weir
- *Outliers* by Malcolm Gladwell
- *Ghost in the Wires* by Kevin Mitnick
- *Ender's Game* by Orson Scott Card

### Recognition

Apparently people took notice of my work, but didn't know where to categorize my contributions. I was shortlisted for [Young Designer of the Year](https://thenetawards.com/vote/young-designer/) while also getting on a list of [2015's Top JS Devs to Follow](http://blog.bithound.io/2015-top-js-devs/) and [Female Tech Influencers](http://skillcrush.com/2015/11/04/50-female-tech-influencers-to-follow-on-twitter/) 💪. One day there will be a place for people like us.

### Personal Goals Outline

So how am I doing on those overall goals I laid out last year?

1. Build quickly, ship things, and learn. *(yep!)*
2. Contribute to Open Source *(hell yeah!)*
3. Share knowledge as often as possible *(definitely!)*
4. Appreciate the creative & talented people in my life *(I try)*
5. Use Vim + the keyboard more often *(yes!)*
6. Up my JS Game *(I'm definitely better but should learn way more)*
7. Performance-first advocacy *(yep!)*
8. Foster designer participation in OS projects *(around me, yes &mdash; outside, maybe?)*
9. Participate in conferences & community *(LOL. yes)*
10. Use web components *(nope)*
11. Be kinder *( ¯\\_ (ツ) _/¯ )*

### Professional Goals

There are so many things I want to learn and get better at! First and foremost, **JavaScript.** I feel like I have a general grasp on most web-development concerns (accessibility, performance, progressive enhancement), and I'm pretty darn good at styling (Sass & CSS). So for me, the next step is to really focus on improving my JavaScript skills from just being functional to having a really good base understanding of how to build and work within a web app. <a class="twitter-share">In the current state of the web, Javascript == Power</a>.

<blockquote class="left">I'm going to share as I learn, so get ready to join the JavaScript train, my friends.
</blockquote>

If you follow me for my CSS content, don't worry &mdash; I'm not going to stop writing about other front-end topics, I just also want to understand flux architecture and all the magics of Webpack. I want to understand good API design and improve my knowledge of algorithms and data structures. I think I just need to start building some apps out for this (and I have a few ideas in mind already!)

I also really want to **write a book** on an entirely different topic &mdash; which is about working with images in the browser. It will cover everything from choosing a media format to performance to getting fancy with filters and blend modes. I'm currently in the process of *looking for a publisher* &mdash; so if you know any interested, feel free to forward them my email address (see footer). *(also, feel free to send me email to say hello, because why not?)*

### Personal Goals

  <figcaption>Look, Mom! I'm upside-down!<figcaption>
</figure>

First and foremost, after years of hackathons and conferences, I've come to realize that my wardrobe has now come to resemble that of a 20-year-old startup bro. Worse still is that I got comfortable wearing these tshirts and jeans every day ~~to work~~ everywhere. I want to **dress better**. And actually make time to go shopping :) that might help. Pinterest too.

I also want to get fit again (yes, I failed at this in 2015 &mdash; but I blame all of the travel). I started taking classes like aerial silks, which were awesome, and I want to continue those while also training for a **half-marathon**. I know it's going to suck at first, but hopefully I'll learn to love running again. I need to prioritize my health.

My last personal goal from 2015 was to be better at **keeping in touch** with people I think I failed on that too. So I'm going to try to better in the future.

### 2016 Goals Overview

I'm cutting this down to fewer and more concise goals than last years. Here they are:

1. **JavaScript.** <br><p style="font-size:85%">It's so powerful, and I want to get much better at it so I can be a powerful wizard, too!</p>
2. **Write a Book** <br><p style="font-size:85%">I have a book idea in mind and I really want to make it a reality.</p>
3. **Bridge the Designer/Developer Gap** <br><p style="font-size:85%">Continue sharing knowledge on front-end topics relevant to both designers and devs.</p>
4. **Build All The Things** <br><p style="font-size:85%">Build things quickly, ship, learn, and then build them better. Open source it all, too.</p>
5. **Prioritize my Health** <br><p style="font-size:85%">Run that half marathon &mdash; fitness is mandatory, not optional.</p>

I'll leave you with this lovely holiday song about the state of developer life from your [Toolsday](http://toolsday.io) hosts (Chris Dhanaraj and me) 😃
