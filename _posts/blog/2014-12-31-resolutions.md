subtitle: This is a personal post about my 2014 in review (because a lot happened) and my goals for 2015. Happy New Year!

So, a lot happened this year.

I [graduated](http://instagram.com/p/n3P-q7STls/) from [college](http://instagram.com/p/ngAFpEyTl0), ran a Design Show, explored Iceland, Dublin, London, Croatia, Montenegro, New York, and San Francisco. I built a cli, a chrome extension, made a few [sass gifs](http://sassgifs.com), built a new online [portfolio](http://unakravets.com), migrated my [blog](http://una.github.io) to Github and my web server to Digital Ocean. <blockquote class="right">I learned to trust strangers half way across the world, canceled all my plans for a week, and joined an impromptu road trip through southeastern Europe. </blockquote> <p> I got a job, bought a car, and drove half way across the country. I moved **three** times this year, and ended up in Austin, Texas. I gave a quick talk at [Sass Conf](http://sassconf.com), spoke at 2 meetups, was on [Sass Bites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO17Tpnh3M), helped organize [SassyDC](http://sassydc.github.io) and start the [ATX Sass Meetup](http://atxsass.com) (so much Sass!). I participated in hackathons, game jams, open sourced my [personal goals](http://una.github.io/personal-goals-guide/), wrote a bunch of blog posts, got pretty good at working with Gulp, used Meteor.js, Express.js, played with a few different templating libraries, and contributed to open source for the first time. I ran **two** half marathons, learned calligraphy, and learned how to use Vim more effectively.

## How am I Doing On My Personal Goals?
These are the [Overarching Goals](https://github.com/una/personal-goals) I outlined in October.

- Use Github more often (check)
- Contribute to Open Source (check)
- Blog more (check)
- Increase project efficiency (check)
- Use the command line & keyboard as much as possible (check)
- Up my JS Game (patterns, Angular, Node) (working on it)
- Learn about testing (sort-of)
- Work on fostering designer participation in open source projects (check)
- Make more people smile (hopefully)
- Learn more about WebGL & 3D graphics (nope)

So that's not too bad, but there's still a lot to work on. And that's exactly what I'll be focusing on next year.

# 2015: Just Do It.

Just do it. Get up and go. Fuck it, ship it. That's my plan. <a class="left twitter-share">Don't think, just do.</a> I've got a lot of ideas and a lot of interests. Here are a few coming down the pipeline, by which I am going to clean up and restructure my public personal goals by (because they got a little messy) after New Years day.

## Professional

Professionally, I want to get better at harnessing the power of JavaScript (sounds so epic, right?). This includes learning **node.js** and understanding **core concepts** better, as well as practicing more often with **MV*** Frameworks and **testing**. I don't use these much at work, but I want to be as fluent in JavaScript (not just jQuery) as I am in Sass.

I also want to continue speaking and getting involved in community. This includes the **open source design** community, being a **Sassvocate**, making people care about **performance**, and being a better advocate of **STEM for girls** (specifically in middle school, but really of all ages). I want to **speak at conferences** and continue to run **ATXSass** with a smile. This year I'll be more organized :)

### Projects in the Pipeline

I'm getting an **arduino** for the holidays (New Years is my family's holiday) and can't wait to get started with it. I have a few ideas already. I am also going to reinstate one of my older projects with a new name, **Heiroglyph** and try to be as open source about the design and development of that as much as possible. I'm doing some free development and design work for a non-profit called **Urban Patchwork** that I met at a hackathon.

As of last week, I was sort-of Twitter challenged to start a podcast. And because of my love for [auditory learning](http://localhost:3000/comprehension/), and since I don't see that many out there, I'm going to start **Caret Cast** early next year. I want to create a **typeface** and learn about **web scraping** to improve the Sass Docs CLI I wrote. I'll continue **blogging** and playing around with libraries and frameworks as I learn about them.

## Personal

All of my personal goals center around health and connectivity. I want to **get fit** again. A way that has worked for me before is to simply start counting my calories, no matter what, for every meal, every day. And since I'm a nerd, to make it more fun, I want to do something with this data. I haven't decided what that will be yet, but I'm trying to get access to the MyFitnessPal API to be able to extract my realtime info. I want to run another **half marathon**, so I'd better start running again too :P Oh and I'm going to sign up for a **dance** class because I really miss dancing and it makes me happy.

I want to be better at **staying in touch** with some of the incredible people I've met over the past few years. I want to pay better attention to their lives and [surprise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3yyF31jbKo) them with random gifts and letters because everyone deserves that.

I also plan on traveling to Asia. I might go to **China** in February, but its pretty last minute, so I'm more looking to going to **Thailand** in April. We'll see what happens when I get there, but I'll definitely be traveling. A weekend trip to **Colorado** or a roadtrip to **Marfa** could be fun, too.

So that's what my year is looking like right now. But I know that plans change, and I'm going to embrace whatever comes my way in 2015 :) See y'all on the flip side!
