<p class="about__text">Hi I'm Una (pronounced like unicorn). I'm currently the Director of Product Design at <a href="https://bustle.company/">Bustle Digital Group</a> and previously was a UI Engineer at <a href="http://digitalocean.com">DigitalOcean</a> and <a href="http://ibm.com/design">IBM Design</a>. I love to <a href="http://instagram.com/unakravets">travel</a>, listen to <a href="https://github.com/una/personal-goals/blob/master/ideas-and-misc/book-checklist.md">audiobooks</a>, and do <a href="http://instagram.com/unadoestype">brush lettering</a>. But you're probably here for some tech shenanigans. That's cool, <a href="https://github.com/una">I do those too</a>. I co-host a podcast about tech tools called<a href="http://toolsday.io">Toolsday</a>, curate and make <a href="https://instagram.com/dev_doodles">Dev Doodles</a>, and speak about experimental CSS/Sass, web performance, accessibility, and more. I've started two Sass Meetups in <a href="http://atxsass.com/">Washington, DC</a> and <a href="http://sassydc.github.io/">Austin, TX</a>, but now live in Brooklyn, NY! Don't hesitate to reach out 😊</p>
