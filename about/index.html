<p class="about__text">Hi I'm Una (pronounced like unicorn). I'm a front-end developer who loves to <a href="http://instagram.com/unakravets">travel</a>, listen to <a href="https://github.com/una/personal-goals/blob/master/ideas-and-misc/book-checklist.md">audiobooks</a>, and do <a href="http://instagram.com/unadoestype">brush lettering</a>. But you're probably here for some tech shenanigans. That's cool, <a href="https://github.com/una">I do those too</a>. I co-host a podcast about tech tools called<a href="http://toolsday.io">Toolsday</a>, write code for a living as a UI engineer at <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a>, and speak about CSS/Sass, web performance, Open Source, and experiments in visual development. I've started two <a href="http://atxsass.com/">Sass</a> <a href="http://sassydc.github.io/">Meetups</a> and promote designers in Open Source as a core member of the <a href="http://opendesign.foundation/">Open Design Foundation</a>. Don't hesitate to reach out!</p>
